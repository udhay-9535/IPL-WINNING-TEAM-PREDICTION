## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ipl-winning-team-prediction.git
    cd ipl-winning-team-prediction
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To use the model for predicting the winner of a match, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your dataset is in the `data` directory.
2. Run the data preprocessing script:
    ```bash
    python preprocess_data.py
    ```
3. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```
4. Make predictions:
    ```bash
    python predict.py --team1 "Team A" --team2 "Team B" --date "YYYY-MM-DD"
    ```

## Model
The machine learning model used in this project is based on a Random Forest classifier. The model is trained on various features extracted from the dataset, including team performance, player statistics, and match conditions.

## Results
After training, the model achieves an accuracy of approximately XX%. The model's performance can be improved by tuning hyperparameters and incorporating additional features.
